# ipfs-demo
A offline, mesh-networking demo of IPFS, originally for use by tomesh.net

**WIP**

## Notes

* Add nginx script so that it reverse proxies the flask server over IPv6 to port 80
* It will be on /demo
* Install script involves importing demo key file
* It's assumed that nodes 1 and 2 are peered over IPFS, and have the daemon started already
